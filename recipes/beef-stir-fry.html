    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Quick and easy beef stir-fry, prepped and ready in less than 30 minutes! This dish utilizes ingredients most people already have in their pantries, but it's very flexible, so you can add/subtract ingredients if you have extra or don't have enough. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made (if you've never had stir-fry before).</p>
